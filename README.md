# nodejs-azure-ad
The application is a Node.js backend API with an AngularJS front end to show the integration with Azure Active Directory authentication.

Clone the repo from Github. This creates a new folder (nodejs-azure-ad) and downloads the code.

<li>git clone https://github.com/ozkary/nodejs-azure-ad.git


Update all the npm packages by typing (from the newly created folder nodejs-azure-ad)

<li>npm init

This should update all the packages that are listed as dependencies in our package.json file. Now that we have the code, we can run it on its current state. From the command line and in our working directory, type the following:

<li>node server
